**rope** data structure
A rope is a data structure that stores a string as a tree of rope_node structs, where each node represents a substring of the string. This allows ropes to be more efficient than regular strings for inserting, deleting, and concatenating substrings, particularly for long strings.

**rope** \*rope_create(void)
This function creates a new rope struct and returns a pointer to it. It initializes the root field to NULL, which indicates that the rope is empty.

void **rope_destroy(rope \*r)**
This function frees the memory allocated for a rope struct and all of its nodes. It takes a pointer to the rope struct as an argument.

void **rope_insert(rope \*r, int index, const char \*data)**
This function inserts a string into a rope at a given index. It takes a pointer to the rope, the index at which to insert the string, and a pointer to the string as arguments.

char **\*rope_to_string(rope \*r)**
This function converts a rope into a null-terminated string and returns a pointer to it. It takes a pointer to the rope as an argument.

int **rope_length(rope \*r)**
This function returns the length of a rope, which is the number of characters it contains. It takes a pointer to the rope as an argument.

**rope_node** data structure
A rope_node is a data structure that represents a substring of a rope. It consists of a null-terminated string to store the data, the length of the string, and pointers to the left and right child nodes, if any.

rope_node **\*rope_node_create(const char \*data, int length)**
This function creates a new **rope_node** struct and returns a pointer to it. It takes a pointer to the data and the length of the data as arguments, and initializes the fields of the struct with these values. It also allocates memory for a null-terminated string to store the data, and copies the data into the string.

void **rope_node_destroy(rope_node \*n)**
This function frees the memory allocated for a **rope_node** struct and all of its children. It takes a pointer to the rope_node as an argument.

void **rope_node_to_string(rope_node \*n, char \*s)**
This function recursively traverses a **rope_node** and its children and concatenates their data to a string. It takes a pointer to the rope_node and a pointer to the string as arguments.

int **rope_node_length(rope_node \*n)**
This function returns the length of a **rope_node**, which is the number of characters it contains. It takes a pointer to the rope_node as an argument.

**main** function
The **main** function is the entry point of the program. It defines a rope data structure to store the text that the user is supposed to type, and creates a string representation of this text using the rope_to_string function. It then displays the text to the user and reads input from the user character by character, comparing it to the text string.

The **main** function keeps track of the current position in the text, the number of correct and incorrect characters typed, and the elapsed time. When the user is finished typing, the main function calculates the typing speed and accuracy and displays the results to the user.
